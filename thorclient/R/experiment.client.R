#' Thor Experiment Client Methods
#'
#' This object defines a Thor experiment within the Python environment. In
#' particular, an experiment is defined by its name, the date at which it was
#' created, and the dimensions of the machine learning model. Moreover, an
#' authentication token is required for requesting new parameter
#' configurations, for submitting observations of parameters, for viewing
#' pending parameter configurations and for obtaining the best configuration
#' of parameters that has been evaluated so far.

create.recommendation <- function(experiment.id, auth.token, rand.prob, n.model.iters, description="") {
  #' Get a recommendation for a point to evaluate next.
  #'
  #' The create recommendation utility represents the core of the Thor Bayesian
  #' optimization software. This function will contact the Thor server and
  #' request a new configuration of machine learning parameters that serve the
  #' object of maximizing the metric of interest.
  #'
  #' @param experiment.id A unique identifier that indicates which experiment
  #' on the server-side is being interacted with by the client.
  #' @param auth.token String containing a user's specific API key provided by
  #' the Thor server. This is used to authenticate with the Thor server as a
  #' handshake that these experiments belong to a user and can be viewed and
  #' edited by them.
  #' @param rand.prob This parameter represents that a random point in the input
  #' space is chosen instead of selecting a configuration of parameters using
  #' Bayesian optimization. As such, this parameter can be used to benchmark
  #' against random search and otherwise to perform pure exploration of the
  #' parameter space.
  #' @param n.model.iters This parameter determines the number of maximum
  #' likelihood random restarts are used to isolate the maximum of the Gaussian
  #' process likelihood with respect to the kernel parameters. Setting this to
  #' a large value will generally provide better probabilistic interpolants of
  #' the metric as a function of the model parameters. In large-scale problems,
  #' this parameter instead controls the number of training iterations used to
  #' fit a Bayesian neural network. In particular, 1,000 times this parameter
  #' epochs are performed.
  #' @param description An optional per-observation descriptor, potentially
  #' useful for identifying one observation among many others in a large
  #' experiment.  Defaults to "".
  #' @return A recommendation client object corresponding to the recommended
  #' set of parameters.
